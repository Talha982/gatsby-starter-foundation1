# What is DED?

Directed energy deposition (DED) processes enable the creation of parts by melting material as it is being deposited. Although this basic approach can work for polymers, ceramics, and metal matrix composites, it is predominantly used for metal powders. Thus, this technology is often referred to as “metal deposition” technology.

# How does DED works?

DED processes direct energy into a narrow, focused region to heat a substrate, melting the substrate and simultaneously melting material that is being deposited into the substrate’s melt pool. Unlike powder bed fusion techniques (see Chap. 5) DED processes are NOT used to melt a material that is pre-laid in a powder bed but is used to melt materials as they are being deposited.

# What are some commercial DED processes?

Commercial DED processes include using a laser or electron beam to melt powders or wires. In many ways, DED techniques can be used in an identical manner to laser cladding and plasma welding machines. For the purposes of this chapter, however, DED machines are considered those which are designed to create complex 3D shapes directly from CAD ﬁles, rather than the traditional welding and cladding technologies, which were designed for repair, joining, or to apply coatings and do not typically use 3D CAD data as an input format.
